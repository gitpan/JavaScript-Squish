JavaScript-Squish
=================

This module provides methods to compact javascript source down to just
what is needed. It can remove all comments, put everything on one line
(semi-)safely, and remove extra whitespace.

Any one of the various compacting techniques can be applied individually,
or with in any group.

It also provides a means by which to extract all text literals or
comments in separate arrays in the order they appear.

Since JavaScript eats up bandwidth, this can be very helpful, and you
can then be free to properly comment your JavaScript without fear of
burning up too much bandwidth.

SYNOPSIS
    use JavaScript::Squish;
    my $compacted = JavaScript::Squish->squish(
                        $javascript,
                        remove_comments_exceptions => qr/copyright/i )
                        or die $JavaScript::Squish::err_msg;

   # OR, to just do a few steps #

    my $c = JavaScript::Squish->new();
    $c->data( $javascript );
    $c->remove_comments(exceptions => qr/copyright/i );
    $c->replace_white_space();
    $c->remove_blank_lines();
    my $new = $c->data();

BUGS

There are a few bugs, which may rear their head in some minor situations.

Statements not terminated by semi-colon.
   These should be ok now - leaving a note here because this hasn't
   been thoroughly tested (I don't have any javascript to test with
   that meets this criteria).

   This would affect statements like the following:

       i = 5.4
       j = 42

   This used to become "i=5.4 j=42", and would generate an error along
   the lines of "expected ';' before statement".

   The linebreak should be retained now. Please let me know if you see
   otherwise.

Ambiguous operator precidence
   Operator precidence may get screwed up in ambiguous statements. Eg.
   "x = y + ++b;" will be compacted into "x=y+++b;", which means some-
   thing different.
