JavaScript-Squish
=================

This module provides methods to compact javascript source down to just
what is needed. It can remove all comments, put everything on one line
(semi-)safely, and remove extra whitespace.

Any one of the various compacting techniques can be applied individually,
or with in any group.

It also provides a means by which to extract all text literals or
comments in separate arrays in the order they appear.

Since JavaScript eats up bandwidth, this can be very helpful, and you
can then be free to properly comment your JavaScript without fear of
burning up too much bandwidth.

SYNOPSIS
    use JavaScript::Squish;
    my $compacted = JavaScript::Squish->squish(
                        $javascript,
                        remove_comments_exceptions => qr/copyright/i )
                        or die $JavaScript::Squish::err_msg;

   # OR, to just do a few steps #

    my $c = JavaScript::Squish->new();
    $c->data( $javascript );
    $c->remove_comments(exceptions => qr/copyright/i );
    $c->replace_white_space();
    $c->remove_blank_lines();
    my $new = $c->data();

BUGS

There are a few bugs, which may rear their head in some minor situations.

Statements not terminated by semi-colon.
    Javascript statement that are NOT terminated by a semi-colon (";")
    may break once compacted, as they will be put on the same line as
    the following statement. In many cases, this wonâbe a problem,
    but it could cause an issue. Ex.

        i = 5.4
        j = 42

    The above would become "i=5.4 j=42", and would generate an error
    along the lines of "expected â before statement".

Ambiguous operator precidence
    Operator precidence may get screwed up in ambiguous statements. Eg.
    "x = y + ++b;" will be compacted into "x=y+++b;", which means something
    different.
